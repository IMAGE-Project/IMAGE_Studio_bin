#Installation

The **IMAGE studio** application is compatible with Windows x64 Operating Systems (e.g. Win7,8,10) and it has two application dependencies: **Windows Installer 3.1** (or a higher version) and **Dot NET Framework 4.5**. Both applications are located in the same directory where the setup files are stored or can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center].
The **‘setup.exe’** file uses Windows Installer for extracting the compressed IMAGE Studio files (located in the **‘IMAGE Setup.msi’** file) and transferring them to the installation folder. Usually, Windows Installer has been installed in the user’s computer from previous applications and there is no need to reinstall it. As with Windows Installer, the Dot NET Framework 4.5 dependency can also be installed via another application. 
Therefore, before the installation of the dependencies, it is advisable that the user first checks for their existence in the **‘Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features’** location.
After the installation of both dependencies (if needed), the user installs the IMAGE Studio using the file **‘setup.exe’** and follows the Setup Wizard.
